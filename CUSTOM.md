# Custom Content in Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield

## Installing Custom Content

### Maps

Custom maps will often come as a `.exe` file which extracts its contents when you run it. You can point these at your game directory to have it put files in the right places. If you have security concerns about running such a program, you can alternatively run the program inside a Windows XP VM and then take out the resulting files.

If the map is already extracted, it will generally have a series of folders to be copied into your game directory: `maps` for the map itself, `system` for the map config, `staticmeshes` and `textures` for some maps, etc. Copy the contents of these folders into their corresponding game folders to install the content.

When playing on servers which allow you to download custom maps, these files will be played in the `<YourGameDir>\Cache` directory. See `Cache.ini` to identify which file is which.

### Sounds

The quickest way to get all the sound files you need for OpenRVS servers is the [AllR6 Sound Pack](http://allr6.com/discuss/viewtopic.php?id=68&i=1), which includes Athena Sword and Iron Wrath sounds.
