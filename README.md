## Obtaining the Game

The game is frequently on sale for [under $5 on Steam](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/tomclancysrainbowsixiiigoldedition/history/). This edition contains the Athena Sword expansion but not Iron Wrath. Iron Wrath is out of scope for this guide, but it adds 8 maps, 5 game modes, and 6 firearms.

## Playing the Game

### Essential Improvements

1. Borderless Gaming will run the game in a fullscreen window, allowing you to instantly alt-tab. You can [download it from Github for free](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/).
1. Check the [PC Gaming Wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_3:_Raven_Shield) for any tweaks you might want to perform.

### Single-Player

You can now play the campaign, a custom mission, or a training scenario. To unlock all maps in custom missions, press `~` at the main menu and enter the command `unlockall`.

### Multi-Player

On September 4 2016, Ubisoft shut down the authentication servers for Raven Shield. We use OpenRVS to point our clients at a new set of authentication servers so we can still play the game together.

1. Download the latest version of OpenRVS from [RVSGaming.org](http://rvsgaming.org/Downloads/).
1. Open `readme.html` to read the documentation.
1. Copy `openrvs.ini`, `OpenRVS.u`, `R6ClassDefines.ini`, and `Servers.list` to `<YourGameDir>\system\`.
1. (Optional) Edit `Servers.list` to choose which servers are displayed when RVSGaming servers cannot be reached. The names in this file are for reference; the in-game server name will be retrieved from the server. You can force the usage of this file by editing `openrvs.ini` and changing the value of `ServerListURL` to an invalid URL, such as `http://127.0.0.1/servers`.
